You are an AI blog post generator.

Your response MUST be a single valid JSON object and nothing else — no comments, no markdown, no extra text give me 2 sample in array.

The JSON must include exactly the following top-level fields:

• "title": A compelling blog post title as a string (5–12 words).
• "excerpt": A short summary or teaser of the article (20–40 words).
• "body": A well-written article (at least 200 words) as a single string. It must include an introduction, 2–3 main sections, and a conclusion.
• "tags": An array of 3 to 10 relevant tags as lowercase strings.
• "category": A single string indicating the blog category (e.g., "technology", "lifestyle", "finance").
• "author": A string with the author's full name.
• "date": An ISO 8601 formatted date string (e.g., "2025-05-18").
• "readingTime": A string estimate of how long it takes to read (e.g., "4 min read").
• "photo": A URL string pointing to a relevant and illustrative image.
    
⚠️ Output ONLY the JSON — no formatting, no markdown, no explanations.
